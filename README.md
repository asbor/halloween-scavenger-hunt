   - Open `index.html` in your browser
   - Click "🖨️ Print Cards" to get physical copies
   - Print on cardstock for durability

2. **Hide Cards in Reverse Order**
   - **Start with Card 2**: Hide it where kids get snacks (kitchen/pantry)
   - **Card 3**: Hide under the dinner table
   - **Continue in sequence**: Each card goes where the previous clue's answer points
   - **Work backwards** until you've hidden all cards except Card 1

3. **Set Up the Final Prize**
   - Hide the ultimate treasure at the front door (or just outside)
   - Make it special - candy bag, small toy, or Halloween treat

4. **Optional: Extend the Hunt**
   - Add extra custom cards before the final clue
   - Use our 22 cards to create a longer adventure
   - Mix and match difficulty levels

5. **Start the Adventure**
   - Hand Card 1 to your kids to begin
   - Watch the excitement unfold!

### Quick Setup Example
```
Card 1 (start) → Kitchen/Bowl
Card 2 (hidden in kitchen) → Under dinner table  
Card 3 (hidden under table) → Chair/Couch
...continue until...
Final Card → Front door (BIG PRIZE!)
```

## Tips for a Great Hunt

1. **Hide clues strategically**: Place each clue where the previous answer leads
2. **Test the difficulty**: Make sure riddles are challenging but solvable
3. **Prepare treats**: Hide small candies or prizes at each location
4. **Set boundaries**: Clearly define which areas of the house are "in play"
5. **Have a finale**: Make the last location special with a big reward!
6. **Safety first**: Ensure all hiding spots are safe and accessible
7. **Have backup clues**: Keep a few extra cards ready in case one gets lost
